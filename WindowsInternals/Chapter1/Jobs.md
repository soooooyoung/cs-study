# Jobs

Windows provides an extension to the process model called a **job**. A job object's main function is to allow the management and manipulation of groups of processes as a unit. A job object allows control of certain attributes and provides limites for the processes associated with the job and for all processes that were associated with the job but have since terminated. In some ways, the job object compensates for the lack of a structured process tree in Windows.
